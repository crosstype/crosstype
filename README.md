## CURRENT STATUS

**State**: Unfinished  
**Status**: Paused, but will be continued

### Latest Update:
Date: April 19th 2022

Much has happened in life and the world since beginning this project! I regret that this is one thing which ended up being set aside for awhile. To answer the immediate question — I still very much intend to finish this project and to see that it can thrive.

As the overall ambition of the project grew, so also went the knowledge and time dedication requirements. However, I still believe that it is well worth the effort.

At the moment, I am working to scale up my business to a point where I will be able to set aside some personal time and also to devote capital to helping fund the completion of this project. For this, I intend to contract some brilliant minds with decades of experience in language design, who can "check my work" to ensure that the AST model is correct. This has been one of the big worries for me — namely, getting it right before release. After this step is done, we will wrap up the development and ensure that it's enterprise ready.

I am hoping that this can be addressed this year, but if recent years have taught me anything, I will not make hasty promises, though I can say that I do remain quite optimistic, given current momentum.
