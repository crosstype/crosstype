# Common TS Helpers

This library includes common helpers & types for TS projects.

While it is used in the crosstype system, it is intended to be a light-weight collection of helpers which have a broad-use 
application, non-specific to crosstype. It is versioned independently (adhering to semver), so others are free to use it
in their projects!

## Categories

- JSON Types
- Utility Types (`OneOrMore`, `RequireSome`, etc)
- Extended TypeScript compiler API methods
- Mixin decorator
- General TS/JS helpers (typed getKeys, pick, omit, etc.)
