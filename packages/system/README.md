# @crosstype/system

This library includes universal utility types, functions, and components.

It is intended to remain light-weight and only house things which can be useful in a broad context. As a result, it is
versioned independently and use within external libraries is encouraged.

## Pre-release Disclaimer

Code is considered `pre-release` status and is therefore subject to change until we reach an RC!

We welcome you to join in the discussion and development effort!
